Love reading books ?! But don't want the hassle of tracking all the books you read like remembering how many pages you read of a book 
or bookmark your favourite books which you want to read again or keep a list of books which you have already read. 
Then you are in the right place :) . In this project what I'm going to do is simple but efficient way of keeping track of your favourite 
books.

In this android app we shall introduce following features.

1. Showing list of available books of different category i.e Islamic,History, Science, Literature, Fictional, Non Fictional etc.
2. User can mark each book as one of this 4 category
	- favourite book
	- already read book 
	- currently reading books
	- add to his/her wishlist
	
3. Different pages for all the mentioned category.
4. More to come ! :p
